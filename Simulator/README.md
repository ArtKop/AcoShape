Simulator of the assembly algorithm
1. Specify the target shape as a square image (white pixels = shape, black pixels = background) named “shape.png”
2. Specify the number of particles in line 8 of main.m
3. Set the parameters in lines 40-43 of main.m (see Materials and Methods of the paper for more details)
4. Run main.m

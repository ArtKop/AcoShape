## Concept
The proposed assembly method includes:
1. Training a neural-network model predicting the particle displacement on the Chladni plate as follows,
```math
E_{n}(\mathbf{p}) = \mathbf{p} + u_n(\mathbf{p}),
```
where ```math  E_{n}(\mathbf{p}) = \mathbf{p} + u_n(\mathbf{p})```

## Results
The results can be found in Supplementary Materials of the paper.

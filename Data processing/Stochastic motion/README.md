The code computes the stochasticity of the particle motion.
1. Load the data from
2. Run plot_error_dynamics.m to compute and plot the position difference between the particle pairs (see Fig. 4B of the paper)
3. Run plot_all_steps.m to plot the trails of individual particle pairs (see Fig. S7 of the paper)
4. Run lyapunov_exp.m to compute and plot the Lyapunov exponents (see Fig. S8 of the paper)

The code computes and plots the trained displacement models ($u_n$) and Chladni figures for every vibration frequency used (see Fig. S1 of the paper).
1. Download export_fig (https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export_fig) into the current folder
2. Run plotAllNotes.m

The Chladni figures are computed according to Tuan's method (see https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-abstract/137/4/2113/940524/Exploring-the-resonant-vibration-of-thin-plates for more details)

The code analyzes the spatially nonlinear motion of particles (see Fig. 4A and Fig. S6 of the paper).

Run "plot_path_to_displacement_ratio.m" to compute the ratios of the distance traveled to the displacement magnitude of the individual particles
involved in the assembly process (see Assembly_raw.gif" and "Assembly_tracked.gif").

The codes trackes the particles and collects the PTV (particle-tracking velocimetry) data for fitting the neural networks.
1. Download the images of particle displacements (Tracktest_2020_5) from https://zenodo.org/record/7977043 into the current folder
2. Run analyze_tracking.m to collect the data of particle displacements, $(  \mathbf{p}, \Delta \mathbf{p})$
